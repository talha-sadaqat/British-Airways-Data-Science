# British-Airways-Data-Science

This project involves web scraping review data from Skytrax, focusing on airline-specific reviews. Utilizing Python within Jupyter Notebook, I am collecting comprehensive data for subsequent analysis.

The initial phase involves scraping data from the website, specifically targeting reviews related to airlines. Once collected, I'll clean and prepare the dataset for analysis, employing Python for data cleaning tasks.

For analysis, I plan to explore various techniques such as topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and word clouds to extract meaningful insights from the reviews. While Python is my primary choice for analysis, I may explore other tools for this purpose.

As part of the project setup, I've created a 'data' folder and ensured the mapping of the file path for organized storage of the obtained data.

The project's ultimate goal is to create a PowerPoint slide summarizing the key insights derived from the analysis. I'll develop visualizations, metrics, and clear explanations within the PowerPoint slide to effectively communicate the findings. This will align with the template provided for submission.

Key Steps:

Scraping airline-specific reviews from Skytrax.
Data cleaning and preparation using Python.
Exploring analysis techniques such as topic modeling and sentiment analysis.
Creation of visual representations for insights.
Summarizing findings in a PowerPoint slide adhering to the provided template.
Tools Used: Python (Jupyter Notebook), PowerPoint

Expected Outcome: A concise PowerPoint slide presenting key insights and discoveries derived from the analysis of airline reviews scraped from Skytrax.
